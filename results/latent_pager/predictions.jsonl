{"id": "longbenchv2_323", "question": "In the DynamiCrafter framework for open-domain image animation, the dual-stream image injection paradigm combines text-aligned context representation and visual detail guidance to generate videos that preserve both high-level context and low-level details. Considering the complexity of synchronizing semantic and spatial consistency in dynamic video generation, which of the following best explains the nuanced interaction between these two streams during the diffusion process? (A) The text-aligned context representation is crucial for embedding the overall scene structure and dynamic flow, which facilitates the understanding of object relationships across video frames. In contrast, the visual detail guidance directly controls the preservation of fine-grained image textures by adding additional image information during the denoising process. This separation ensures that the diffusion model can handle larger structural dynamics while minimizing texture distortion at the pixel level, but at the potential cost of losing minor contextual semantics during complex motions. (B) The dual-stream paradigm works by disentangling spatial and temporal aspects of video generation: the text-aligned context focuses on maintaining temporal coherence by providing a consistent interpretation of object movements, while the visual detail guidance ensures spatial fidelity across frames. This separation allows the model to prioritize dynamic scene changes over fine-tuning appearance consistency, which is particularly beneficial when the text prompts introduce new movements that diverge from the static input image. (C) The dual-stream system dynamically balances context and detail by leveraging the text-aligned context for synthesizing motions that align semantically with the text prompt, while the visual detail guidance ensures the preservation of image content, even in scenarios where large semantic changes are introduced by the prompt. Although both streams contribute to temporal coherence, the system sacrifices some fine structural details when the text-aligned context shifts focus towards interpreting complex dynamics. (D) In DynamiCrafter, both the text-aligned context and visual detail guidance streams interact synergistically to ensure that temporal coherence and spatial fidelity are maintained throughout the video. The text-aligned context representation provides a high-level understanding of motion and scene structure, while the visual detail guidance compensates for any information loss during this process by embedding the image directly into the noise generation. This method avoids sacrificing either semantic understanding or fine details, ensuring both are preserved even when complex motions and scene changes occur.", "gold_answer": "In DynamiCrafter, both the text-aligned context and visual detail guidance streams interact synergistically to ensure that temporal coherence and spatial fidelity are maintained throughout the video.
